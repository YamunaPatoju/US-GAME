# US-GAME
US GAME
This Python script lets players guess U.S. states and shows their guesses on a map. The game ends when all 50 states are guessed, or the player decides to quit. It uses the turtle module for the map and pandas to manage the state data.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.Displays a U.S. map using the turtle module.
2.Asks players to guess state names.
3.Shows the correct guesses on the map at the right locations.
4.Continues until all 50 states are guessed or the player exits.
Uses pandas to manage and check the state data.
5.Saves any missed states to a CSV file.

FEATURES:
-Displays a blank map of the U.S. with state coordinates.
-Allows the player to guess state names.
-Writes the name of each correctly guessed state on the map at the corresponding coordinates.
-Saves any missed states to a CSV file after the game ends.
